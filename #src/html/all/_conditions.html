            <h2 class="policy__subtitle">OUR SERVICE</h2>
            <p class="policy__text">This site is owned and operated by MediaBlanket Limited. We are not a Lender or
               Provider and therefore We will not provide finance directly to You; We provide an online credit broking
               service, We will introduce You to Lenders or Providers of financial services. By submitting an
               application through Our form or Comparison Site You will be giving Your consent for MediaBlanket to match
               Your application with one of the Lenders or Providers on Our panel. If You apply via Our online form, We
               will present Your application in real time to one or more of Our Lenders or Providers based on their
               lending criteria until such time as one of Our Lenders or Providers accepts Your application or all
               Lenders and Providers decline Your application OR if You apply via Our Comparison Site We will present to
               Lender products to You. If a Lender or Provider accepts Your application You will be forwarded to a page
               on the Lender or Provider’s Website that they have requested We direct You to or if the Lender or
               Provider does not work online We may present You with a screen that gives You information and contact
               details relating to the Lender or Provider that accepts You. It is important to understand that We will
               only forward You to a Lender or Provider that has looked at Your application and accepted it as one they
               believe there is a good chance they can provide a loan or relevant services to You, (if You have
               submitted an online form application), or We will only display to You a Lender or Provider that is
               relevant to your search, (if You have used our Comparison Site). It is also important to understand that
               We may be paid a fee by the Lender or Provider for introducing You to them and We may pay a portion of
               that fee to the Website owner that is using the iframe form as a service.</p>

            <p class="policy__text">There is no obligation for You to take up the loan or service with them. You should
               read their conditions
               carefully and make a responsible decision on whether You believe their service is right for You. You will
               be signing a legally binding credit agreement when if you accept their terms. If You have any questions
               or are unsure You should contact the Lender or Provider before taking out any service or loan with them.
            </p>

            <p class="policy__text">Any examples of amounts available to borrow, terms (repayment periods) or rates
               stated on the Lender or
               Provider Websites are purely given as a representative example relating to the product. These
               representative examples are stated to give You an understanding of the products available. Representative
               examples are not given as a figure of what You will actually be offered by the Lender/Finance Provider
               therefore cannot be given as a guarantee nor can they be used as any kind of warranty. As We do not
               provide the loan or financial service directly to You We are unable to control the representative rate
               examples contained on the Website. Please also be aware that the decision to offer any loan or financial
               service is made by the Lender or Finance Provider and We have no control over the decision making.</p>

            <p class="policy__text">The Lender/Finance Provider will conduct an assessment on You before any decision or
               offer is made; this
               may include a full assessment of Your credit history both past and present.</p>

               searches), and credit reference agencies can also help prevent fraudulent applications so We ask You to
               agree to using data provided for the purpose of preventing fraud and ensuring the Your identity is

               the consent of the other and if correspondence is entered into with one party of the joint application it
               shall be assumed that the communication is with both parties.</p>
